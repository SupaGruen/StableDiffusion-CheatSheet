# Stable Diffusion Cheat-Sheet

This began as a personal collection of styles and notes. I was curious to see how the artists used in the prompts looked without the other keywords.

[Download the zip file](https://github.com/SupaGruen/StableDiffusion-CheatSheet/releases) and use it as your own personal cheat-sheet - **completely offline**.

## Artist Inspired Styles

- Over 700 manually tested styles
- Copy the style prompt with one click
- Search and filter
- One click to look up the artist via search engine

## Image Metadata and Notes

- **Check image metadata without the need to start Stable Diffusion and completely offline**, just drag and drop
- Some extra notes to help with art styles
- Calculate image dimensions easily

## Just the Data

All the information, but without preview images, is also listed in 'only-data.html'.

There, you'll find everything that's in the JSON data. Date of birth (and death, if deceased), categories, notes, and a list of artists that were checked but are unknown to Stable Diffusion.
